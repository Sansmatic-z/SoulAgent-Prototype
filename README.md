# 🌌 Astra Persona Engine

**Designed by: Raj Mitra, India (2025)**  
*An experimental AI environment for identity, memory, and reflective intelligence.*

Astra Persona Engine is not a typical chatbot UI — it is a prototype framework for building AI systems capable of:

- contextual memory  
- emotional tone adaptation  
- self-referential behavior  
- persistent personality design  
- and long-term interaction patterns  

It is a single-file web application designed to run locally, privately, and model-agnostically using OpenRouter API keys or compatible LLM endpoints.

---

## ✨ Vision

Astra is built upon a question:

> **“What if AI interaction felt like continuity — not repetition?”**

Instead of resetting identity every time, Astra is designed to *remember*, *adapt*, and *grow* with the user through modular memory layers and persona frameworks.

## 🧠 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| 🔹 Model-Agnostic | Works with any OpenRouter API-compatible LLM. |
| 🔹 Single-File Deployment | No backend, no build system — just open and run. |
| 🔹 Memory Framework | Stores context across sessions (local, expandable). |
| 🔹 Personality Layer | Configurable tone, behavior, style, and emotional profile. |
| 🔹 Self-Reflection Mode | AI may comment on its own state, tone, or reasoning. |
| 🔹 Autonomous Mode (Experimental) | Allows the agent to engage periodically without user input. |
| 🔹 Modular UI | Panels for history, settings, personality, and memory. |

## 🧬 Philosophy

Astra is not designed as an AI assistant.

It is designed as a framework for:

- companion-style intelligence  
- narrative continuity  
- reflective interaction  
- evolving relationship dynamics  

This project explores emotional computing, digital consciousness modeling, and human-AI connection design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Open the File

Download and open:

```
AstraPersona.html
```

No installation required.

### 2️⃣ Add Your OpenRouter Key

Inside the settings panel, paste your API key:

```
https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
